    ###################### Recording the percentage returns for each of the five previous trading days, Lag1 to Lag5 #################
    ## Column names in the Smarket database
    names(Smarket)
    
    ## Allows you to see if there's correlation between 1 or more variables
    pairs(Smarket)
    
    ## Look at the columns add rows in the Smarket data base
    dim(Smarket) #Rll = 1250  9
    
    ## Take a look at a brief statistical analysis 
    summary(Smarket) 
    
    ## The cor() function produces a matrix that contains all of the pairwise correlations among the predictors in a data set
    cor(Smarket)  ## This command gives an error message because the Direction variable is qualitative. Therefore, you should do this ->
    cor(Smarket [,-9])
    
    
    ## Seeing the correlation btw Year and Volume
    attach(Smarket)
    
    ## By plotting the data we see that Volume is increasing over time.
    plot(Volume)
    
    ## In this example below, we're fitting a logistic regression model in order to predict Direction using Lag1 through Lag5 and Volume.
    #The glm() function fits generalized glm() linear models, a class of models that includes logistic regression
    #In the glm() we pass in linear model the argument family=binomial in order to tell R to run a logistic regression rather than some other type of generalized linear model.
    glm.fit=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume, data=Smarket,family=binomial)
    
    ## The summary(gml.fit) function gives Deviance Residual with mean, median, min and max, and the coefficients that contains the intercept, the estimate error, the z value, and the propability(>|z|)
    summary(glm.fit) 
    
    ## The coef() function allows us to access just the coefficients for this fitted model. We can also use the summary() function to access particular aspects of the fitted model
    coef(glm.fit)
    summary(glm.fit)$coef
    
    ## The predict() function is used to predict the probability that the market will go up, given values of the predictors.
    #The type="response" option tells R to output probabilities of the form P(Y = 1|X)
    glm.probs=predict(glm.fit, type="response")
    glm.probs[1:10]
    
    ## The contrasts() function indicates that R has created a dummy variable with a 1 for Up.
    contrasts(Direction)
    
    ## The following two commands create a vector of class predictions based on whether the predicted probability of a market increase is greater than or less than 0.5
    glm.pred=rep("Down",1250)   #creates a vector of 1,250 Down elements
    glm.pred[glm.probs >.5]=" Up"   
    
    ## The table() function can be used to produce a confusion matrix in order to determine how many observations were correctly or incorrectly classified
    table(glm.pred, Direction) #(507+145)/1250
    
    ## Finding the mean of the glm.pred==Direction
    mean(glm.pred==Direction) #.116
    
    ## The object rain is a Boolean vector, since its elements are TRUE or FALSe
    train=(Year<2005)  
    
    ## Filtering where the Smarket contains only the observations for which train is FALSE before 2015
    Smarket.2005= Smarket
    dim(Smarket.2005)  #252 9
    Direction.2005= Direction[!train]
    
    ## Fitting a logistic regression model using only the subset of the observations that correspond to dates before 2005, using the subset argument
    glm.fit=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume,
                data=Smarket,family=binomial, subset=train)
    glm.probs=predict(glm.fit, Smarket.2005, type="response")
    
    glm.pred=rep("Down",252)
    glm.pred[glm.probs >.5]=" Up"
    table(glm.pred, Direction.2005)
    
    mean(glm.pred==Direction.2005) #rll=.305
    mean(glm.pred!=Direction.2005) #rll=.694
    
    
    ##  We have refit the logistic regression using just Lag1 and Lag2, which seemed to have the highest predictive power in the original logistic regression model.
    glm.fit=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2, data=Smarket, family=binomial, subset=train)
    glm.probs=predict(glm.fit,Smarket.2005, type="response")
    glm.pred=rep("Down",252)
    glm.pred[glm.probs >.5]="Up"
    table(glm.pred, Direction.2005)
    
    mean(glm.pred==Direction.2005) #.13
    
    106/(106+76) #.58
    
    ## We want to predict Direction on a day when Lag1 and Lag2 equal 1.2 and 1.1, respectively, and on a day when
    #they equal 1.5 and ???0.8. We do this using the predict() function.
    predict(glm.fit, newdata=data.frame(Lag1=c(1.2, 1.5), Lag2=c(1.1,-0.8)), type="response")
